# Chord Spillover Bug Fix

## Problem Description

**Critical Bug**: In practice mode, keys held from previous chords were incorrectly being counted as correct for the next step, even though they were never freshly pressed for the new step.

### Bug Scenario
1. User plays chord: G4 + E5 + C4 (MIDI notes 67, 76, 60)
2. Practice system correctly evaluates chord as CORRECT
3. Cursor advances to next step: single note C4 (60)
4. User releases E5 + G4 but keeps holding C4 from previous chord
5. **BUG**: System incorrectly marks C4 as CORRECT even though it was never freshly pressed for the new step

### Root Cause Analysis

The original system only tracked "currently pressed keys" (`Set<number>`) but didn't differentiate between:
- Keys held from previous steps (should NOT count)
- Keys freshly pressed for current step (should count)

The evaluation logic in `compareNotes()` only checked if currently pressed keys matched expected keys, with no consideration of WHEN those keys were pressed.

## Solution Implementation

### Architecture: Event-Driven Fresh Key Tracking

Instead of relying solely on current key state, the system now tracks "fresh key presses" within each practice step.

#### Key Changes

1. **Fresh Key State Tracking** (`usePracticeController.ts`)
   ```typescript
   // Track keys that were pressed AFTER the current step became active
   const [freshlyPressedKeys, setFreshlyPressedKeys] = useState<Set<number>>(new Set());
   ```

2. **MIDI Event Subscription** (`MidiContext.tsx`)
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced context provides event subscription for practice mode
   subscribeMidiEvents: (callback: (event: MidiEvent) => void) => () => void;
   ```

3. **Fresh Key Detection** (`usePracticeController.ts`)
   ```typescript
   // MIDI event handler to track fresh key presses
   const handleMidiEvent = useCallback((event: MidiEvent) => {
     if (event.type === 'noteOn') {
       setFreshlyPressedKeys(prev => new Set(prev).add(event.note));
     }
   }, []);
   ```

4. **Step Reset Logic**
   ```typescript
   // Reset freshly pressed keys when the current step changes
   useEffect(() => {
     setFreshlyPressedKeys(new Set());
   }, [currentStep]);
   ```

5. **Evaluation Logic Update**
   ```typescript
   // Evaluate based on fresh keys instead of all pressed keys
   const freshKeysArray = Array.from(freshlyPressedKeys);
   handleKeysChanged(freshKeysArray);
   ```

### Implementation Flow

1. **Step Initialization**: When a new practice step begins, `freshlyPressedKeys` is reset to empty
2. **MIDI Event Handling**: `noteOn` events add keys to `freshlyPressedKeys` set
3. **Evaluation**: Only keys in `freshlyPressedKeys` are considered for correctness
4. **Step Advancement**: Fresh key tracking resets for the new step

## Technical Details

### Modified Files

#### `/src/renderer/features/practice-mode/hooks/usePracticeController.ts`
- Added `freshlyPressedKeys` state tracking
- Added MIDI event subscription via `subscribeMidiEvents`
- Modified evaluation logic to use fresh keys instead of all pressed keys
- Added reset logic for step changes

#### `/src/renderer/contexts/MidiContext.tsx`
- Added `subscribeMidiEvents` method to context interface
- Implemented event forwarding to subscribers
- Enhanced MIDI event handler to distribute events to practice mode

#### `/src/renderer/App.tsx`
- Updated MIDI event handler to support practice mode event distribution

### Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing `pressedKeys` state is preserved for piano highlighting
- Non-practice mode behavior unchanged
- All existing MIDI functionality continues to work

### Performance Considerations

- Minimal overhead: Only adds event subscription during active practice
- Clean subscription management with proper cleanup
- No impact on non-practice mode performance

## Validation

### Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `__tests__/bug-fixes/chord-spillover-fix.test.ts`:
- Validates fresh key tracking logic
- Tests chord spillover scenarios
- Verifies state management during step transitions
- Covers edge cases (rapid key presses, extra keys)

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Spillover Test**:
   - Play chord, advance to single note step
   - Hold one key from chord, verify it's not counted as correct
   - Release and re-press same key, verify it's now correct

2. **Complex Chord Sequences**:
   - Multiple chord-to-chord transitions
   - Chord-to-single-note transitions
   - Single-note-to-chord transitions

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Rapid key releases and presses
   - Multiple keys held between steps
   - Mixed held/fresh key scenarios

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Practice mode now correctly distinguishes held vs fresh key presses
2. **Learning**: Users must properly articulate each note/chord as intended
3. **Realism**: Matches real piano playing where each note requires deliberate action
4. **Reliability**: Eliminates false positives in practice evaluation

## Future Considerations

### Sustain Pedal Support
When sustain pedal functionality is added, the system will need to decide whether sustained notes should be treated as "held" or "fresh" for practice evaluation.

### Timing Windows
Could add configurable timing windows to allow brief overlaps between steps (legato playing style).

### Advanced Features
The fresh key tracking foundation enables future features like:
- Timing analysis (how quickly user responds to new steps)
- Velocity tracking (dynamics practice)
- Articulation detection (staccato vs legato)

## Conclusion

This fix resolves a critical bug that was undermining the accuracy of practice mode evaluation. By implementing event-driven fresh key tracking, the system now correctly distinguishes between held keys and intentionally pressed keys, providing accurate feedback for music learning.
